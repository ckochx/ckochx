# Getting Started with Ckochx

Welcome to Ckochx, a modern web server framework built with Elixir! This guide will help you understand the core concepts and get you up and running quickly.

## What is Ckochx?

Ckochx is a lightweight, high-performance web server built on top of Elixir's robust ecosystem. It combines the power of:

- **Elixir** - For fault-tolerant, concurrent processing
- **Plug** - For composable web application building blocks  
- **Bandit** - For fast HTTP/2 and WebSocket support
- **Tailwind CSS** - For modern, responsive styling

## Key Features

### Static File Serving
Efficiently serve CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static assets with built-in caching and compression support.

### Hot Code Reloading
Development-friendly with automatic code reloading for rapid iteration and testing.

### Fault Tolerance
Built on Elixir's "let it crash" philosophy with supervisor trees for maximum reliability.

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, make sure you have Elixir installed on your system. Then clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ckochx
mix deps.get
```

### Running the Server

Start the development server:

```bash
mix run --no-halt
```

Your server will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Project Structure

```
ckochx/
├── lib/
│   ├── ckochx.ex              # Main application module
│   ├── ckochx/
│   │   ├── application.ex     # OTP application
│   │   └── web_server.ex      # Plug router
├── priv/
│   ├── static/                # Static assets
│   └── blog/                  # Blog posts
└── mix.exs                    # Project configuration
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Ckochx running, you can:

1. **Customize the styling** - Modify the Tailwind CSS classes in the HTML files
2. **Add new routes** - Extend the router in `web_server.ex`
3. **Create blog posts** - Add markdown files to the `priv/blog/posts` directory
4. **Deploy to production** - Configure for your hosting environment

Happy coding with Ckochx!
